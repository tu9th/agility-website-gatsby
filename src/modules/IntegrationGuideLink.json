The brand needed a back-end system that would unite its team and provide a seamless and consistent user experience that allowed them to make frequent updates to the site as new films and showtimes get frequently added and refreshed through Cineplex&rsquo;s back-end systems. Speed to market was crucial for them as well. They needed to be able to do have things quicker in order to get better conversions.</p>\r\n<p>At the time, Cineplex also wanted to expand its website to include online sales and ticketing which would include optimization to their movie search functionality.</p>",

The site was integrated with Cineplex&rsquo;s internal systems, which includes their back-end show time and ticketing database, as well as their internal ticket-purchase ecommerce engine.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, Cineplex rebuilt the site again on top of Agility&rsquo;s flexible and intuitive CMS platform&rsquo;s codebase. The new site had to be optimized for mobile to provide a user-friendly experience on every screen size (desktop, tablet, mobile). This newest iteration has a responsive design and uses newer front-end and back-end technologies.</p>\r\n<p>With each rebuild, Agility&rsquo;s CMS allowed Cineplex to increase the scalability of the site and to optimize its hosting resources. The latest iteration utilizes a new hosting environment across load-balanced servers for optimal site speed and performance. The site is now handling more traffic with less CPU load than in previous years.</p>\r\n<h3>Backend administration is drastically streamlined</h3>\r\n<p>The Cineplex team has been extremely happy with the Agility CMS team and platform in each redesign and rebuild of their site.</p>\r\n<p>Their traffic impressions are now successfully maintained, their backend administration is drastically simplified and streamlined and the overall usability of the site has improved.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"I love that Agility gives us the ability to quickly iterate and build components.

Uptime on occasions such as Black Friday and the holiday seasons was also a significant concern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only was it challenging to manage, but it was also expensive, both from a hosting/software licensing perspective as well as the stress of having to hire more staff to keep up with ticket demand.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Our Solution</h3>\n<p>To empower Visit Orlando content management team and increate tickets sales, Agility CMS developed the custom <a href=\"www.agilitycms.com/resources/posts/headless-commerce-explained-definitions-use-cases-and-roadblocks\" target=\"_self\">Headless Commerce</a> solution with the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-site, multi-channel Content Management</li>\n<li>Ecommerce with Online Ticket Sales</li>\n<li>POS Ticket Sales</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>On the first day after the roll-out of the new ticket purchasing website and POS solution, the team lead at Visit Orlando emailed us to show how much more revenue they have saved and increased, just by turning on the new website.</p>\n<p>The user experience was immediately improved not only for the customers browsing online to purchase tickets, but also for the employees taking orders in person, and for the content management team using the backend.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>Online Revenue was increased by 20%</li>\n<li>Conversion Rate on the website was increased by 10%</li>\n<li>Online Engagement increased by 25%</li>\n<li>CIO and Director both remarked that they had taken a 4-day weekend for Thanksgiving for the first time in many years!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Check Out Visit Orlando Site <a href=\"https://www.visitorlando.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here</a>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.visitorlando.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"539\" alt=\"Things to do in Orlando : 20% increase in revenue with agile Headless Commerce\" src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/annotation-2020-05-16-144929.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></a></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Read More Success Stories:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/case-studies/cineplex\" target=\"_self\">Cineplex: Movie Theater Giant with Outstanding Content Architecture&nbsp;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/case-studies/hockey-canada\" target=\"_self\">90% Load Time improvement in Hockey Canada&rsquo;s Performance During Peal Times</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/case-studies/scene\" target=\"_self\">Omnichannel Customer Experience for SCENE Rewards Program&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

They were also hoping to find a platform that was flexible and that allowed them to increase their speed to market of content and updates.</span></span><span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/screenshot-2020-09-15-173814.png\" alt=\"omnichannel marketing case study scene\" width=\"552\" height=\"321\" caption=\"false\" /></span></span></p>\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n<p>SCENE was looking to become more agile in getting content and design updates live on the SCENE website. They wanted a system that was simple to use and that they could administer themselves efficiently and effectively with internal resources. Their current system was extremely limiting and did not meet their technology needs.</p>\n<p>In addition, and like many businesses at the time, they maintained a separate mobile version of the SCENE website, m.scene.ca. This allowed them to optimize for the influx of mobile traffic they were seeing on the site. Over time, however, this mobile site became difficult to manage and SCENE quickly found that their desktop and mobile sites were two conflicting strains on their resources. By 2016, mobile traffic was accounting for more than half of all traffic, and SCENE knew that a single site with a mobile-responsive design was the answer.</p>\n<p>The SCENE team was also planning on launching a new mobile app and they wanted to be able to update app content themselves, using the same CMS tool as their desktop site to ensure consistency. They were aware of the need for a mobile-first strategy and wanted to ensure that their members were able to access the site in the most convenient way possible, whether via their desktop computer, mobile browser or mobile app.</p>\n<p>Finally, as part of their long-term strategy, SCENE wanted to build a site that was scalable and that would be able to accommodate future business needs and technologies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/screenshot-2020-09-15-173847.png\" alt=\"Scene mobile app\" caption=\"false\" /></p>\n<h3><span>The Solution</span></h3>\n<p>SCENE chose to work with Agility based on our ability to customize their site to their exact needs, as well as our flexibility with integrations. As part of the website rebuild, we worked with the SCENE marketing team, a design agency, a mobile app builder and the SCENE&rsquo;s platform partner.</p>\n<p>One of the main benefits of the Agility solution was our customized and flexible integration with the platform host. While registrant data is still housed by Scene, all content can be delivered and updated from the Agility platform, which means that SCENE now has full control over their offers and rewards.</p>\n<p>In terms of the website and mobile app, our platform has enabled SCENE to easily and intuitively update all content whenever needed, with no technical skills ever required. The big benefit about managing all content from one hub is that there is no need to make updates multiple times (on their desktop, mobile and app sites and their kiosks); content is automatically updated across the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another important element we took into consideration when building SCENE&rsquo;s new website and mobile app was ensuring that we built a framework that could accommodate not only today&rsquo;s design capabilities and technologies, but also future ones. This is reflected in the site&rsquo;s content architecture, which was specifically tailored to SCENE&rsquo;s unique business needs and requirements and built with scalability in mind.<span></span></p>\n<h3><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/bigstock-omni-channel-or-multi-channel-80605046.jpg\" alt=\"omnichannel marketing\" width=\"536\" height=\"537\" /></h3>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Agility has given SCENE full power and control over their content, enabling them to easily manage their digital channels and provide their customers with an improved online experience.</p>\n<p>Customers are now able to access all membership information through their desktop site, mobile site or mobile app, including transactions, account history, personalized offers, point balances and point redemption. Content is easy to update instantly through Agility and data across vendors is automatically delivered.</p>\n<p>SCENE has cited the ease of use of the Agility platform as a top benefit thanks to its logical and intuitive user interface, which non-technical members of their team find easy to use and to publish content on. This has allowed them to easily populate the site and to deliver content quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><strong><span></span></strong></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;

They were also hoping to find a platform that was flexible and that allowed them to increase their speed to market content and updates.</p>\r\n<h2>A Limited System with Poor Mobile Site Deployment&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>SCENE was looking to become more agile in getting content and design updates live on the SCENE website. They wanted a system that was simple to use and that they could administer themselves efficiently and effectively with internal resources. Their current system was extremely limiting and did not meet their technology needs.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, and like many businesses at the time, they maintained a separate mobile version of the SCENE website, m.scene.ca. This allowed them to optimize for the influx of mobile traffic they were seeing on the site. Over time, however, this mobile site became difficult to manage and SCENE quickly found that their desktop and mobile sites were two conflicting strains on their resources. By 2016, mobile traffic was accounting for more than half of all traffic, and SCENE knew that a single site with a mobile-responsive design was the answer.</p>\r\n<p>The SCENE team was also planning on launching a new mobile app and they wanted to be able to update app content themselves, using the same CMS tool as their desktop site to ensure consistency. They were aware of the need for a mobile-first strategy and wanted to ensure that their members were able to access the site in the most convenient way possible, whether via their desktop computer, mobile browser or mobile app.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, as part of their long-term strategy, SCENE wanted to build a site that was scalable and that would be able to accommodate future business needs and technologies.</p>",

As part of the website rebuild, we worked with the SCENE marketing team, a design agency, a mobile app builder, and SCENE&rsquo;s platform partner.</p>\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of the Agility solution was our customized and flexible integration with the platform host. While registrant data is still housed by Scene, all content can be delivered and updated from the Agility platform, which means that SCENE now has full control over its offers and rewards.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of the website and mobile app, our platform has enabled SCENE to easily and intuitively update all content whenever needed, with no technical skills ever required. The big benefit about managing all content from one hub is that there is no need to make updates multiple times (on their desktop, mobile, and app sites and their kiosks); content is automatically updated across the board.</p>\r\n<p>Another important element we took into consideration when building SCENE&rsquo;s new website and mobile app was ensuring that we built a framework that could accommodate not only today&rsquo;s design capabilities and technologies, but also future ones. This is reflected in the site&rsquo;s content architecture, which was specifically tailored to SCENE&rsquo;s unique business needs and requirements and built with scalability in mind.</p>\r\n<h2>Easy Content Updates</h2>\r\n<p>Agility has given SCENE full power and control over their content, enabling them to easily manage their digital channels and provide their customers with an improved online experience.</p>\r\n<p>Customers are now able to access all membership information through their desktop site, mobile site, or mobile app, including transactions, account history, personalized offers, point balances, and point redemption. Content is easy to update instantly through Agility and data across vendors is automatically delivered.</p>\r\n<p>SCENE has cited the ease of use of the Agility platform as a top benefit thanks to its logical and intuitive user interface, which non-technical members of their team find easy to use and to publish content on. This has allowed them to easily populate the site and to deliver content quickly and efficiently.<strong></strong></p>",

                      "textblob": "<p>The main benefit of headless CMS is that it provides a much more flexible and efficient way to maintain a sophisticated content architecture across multiple digital properties. The \"compose once, publish everywhere\" paradigm is a major factor in why folks choose headless CMS. Send content to mobile apps, websites, social networks, marketing automation platforms, and more... the list is as long as your digital strategy.</p>\n<p>Most headless platforms eschew the concept of \"page management.\" They claim that the separation of content from its presentation disallows the management of \"pages,\" as they are only intended for a single output - your website. While this is true, it also ignores the fact that the main anchor for online content is your website, and it needs a special case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/agility-sneak-peek_-headless-page-management-1.jpg\" alt=\"Agility CMS quote \" width=\"699\" height=\"367\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<h2>Why Page Management?</h2>\n<p>One of the main benefits of a <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/video/how-is-agility-cms-different-traditional-cms-vs-headless-cms-explained\" target=\"_self\">headless CMS</a> is that it enables companies to build a modern content architecture across different digital platforms and devices. Headless CMSs allow content teams to compose once and then publish everywhere, sending content to every platform and device customers are using.</p>\n<p>However, while headless CMSs give you robust functionalities, some vendors claim that the separation of content and presentation that characterizes the <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/guide/what-is-a-headless-cms\" target=\"_self\">headless architecture</a> makes the concept of <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/page-management-in-agility-cms-vs-other-headless-cmss\">page management</a> obsolete. In most headless CMSs you often get a blank site that you can configure the way you like. While that&rsquo;s a great approach, we also provide out-of-the-box, and even go a bit beyond that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite being headless, we think differently. We see websites as the anchor for your digital experiences, which is why we give websites special treatment.</p>\n<p>Since part of our premise is to make things easier for everybody, we&rsquo;ve added a robust page management system that&rsquo;s meant to simplify the lives of the content team, enabling them to create and manage actual pages on our sitemap.</p>\n<p>One of the things that makes <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/\">Agility CMS</a> different from other CMSs is that it is content first and offloads the task of page management to the content marketing team. With Agility, content teams are enabled to update pages and sitemaps without the help of the IT team.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_d570d790-ff90-49f5-aee8-ea309904bcb4\">Benefits of Page Management</h3>\n<p><span>Using Page Management, you can empower editors to create and manage pages for your digital solutions using re-usable building blocks (i.e. modules &amp; page templates).</span></p>\n<p><span>Editors can manage your site's page tree, page-level SEO properties, and determine what content and functionality will be on each page.</span></p>\n<p><span>As a developer and architect, you still have full control over what page templates are available to the editor, where they can place modules within the page, and what the modules can do.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Empowered editors who can do more without a developer</li>\n<li>Happier developers who can focus on new functionality and enhancements, and less time responding to new content requirements</li>\n<li>Increased productivity</li>\n<li>Fewer resources/expenses required</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_d9380afc-2ad6-4085-875b-c8dd08c3bca3\"><span>Why do you need Page Management in Headless CMS?</span></h3>\n<p><span>We've curated a list of common scenarios showcasing situations editors and/or developers may have experienced:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><em>I need to create a new landing page specifically for the press. It will have the exact same content layout as the home page, but just different content.</em></span></li>\n<li><span><em>I need to be able to set the SEO properties for each page such as Meta Tags and Meta Descriptions.</em></span></li>\n<li><em>On the home page, we want the YoutTube video to be BELOW the Main Rich Text, but on our press page, we want the YouTube video to remain ABOVE the Main Rich Text.</em></li>\n<li><em>Our CEO doesn't like it, can we have the YouTube video ABOVE the Main Rich Text area on the homepage again?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the scenarios above, you can see that the editor's needs are impossible to predict. It's not their fault, it's just the nature of the game. Managing content comes with a lot of changes.</p>\n<p>Not taking advantage of Page Management for your digital solution means It's<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>not flexible</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for editors, so developers spend most of their time taking orders, tinkering with existing code to support content requirements, and wishing they were doing something else! Content changes should not have to involve developers.</p>\n<p>So what does this ultimately mean?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editors cannot create/manage pages on their own without a developer</li>\n<li>Editors cannot control which components are on each page</li>\n<li>Developers get bored or burnt out</li>\n<li>More development resources/expenses required</li>\n<li>Productivity on the website suffers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, who's at fault in this? I'll give you a hint, it's not the editor, and it's not the developer... It's<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>the architecture</strong>!&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_66ced9a2-1807-4886-8e7e-2d77a4801774\">Common Scenarios</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Editor:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>I need to create a new landing page specifically for the press. It will have the exact same content layout as the home page, but just different content.</em></p>\n<p>You would need to go back into your code and add another static page in your website to handle the routing for your new landing page, then create a new item in the CMS to represent the content for that page, take note of the content ID and then likely spend some time refactoring your code now that you are using it in two different places.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Editor</strong></em><em>:&nbsp;I need to be able to set the SEO properties for each page such as Meta Tags and Meta Description.</em></p>\n<p>You would need to add these additional fields to the&nbsp;<strong>Landing Page</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>content model, go back in your code, read those properties, and output them in the appropriate place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Editor:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>On the home page, we want the YoutTube video to be BELOW the Main Rich Text, but on our press page we want the YouTube video to remain ABOVE the Main Rich Text.</em></p>\n<p>This is where it gets tricky. Both the home page and press page are using the same content model and HTML template. The editor does not have the ability to set the order of content being rendered on the page, because that's hardcoded in your HTML template. Now you have some decisions to make. Do you hard-code some logic in your website to adjust the order only if the current page is the home page? Or do you split your code altogether and use a slightly different HTML template for each page? Neither option sounds great or scalable, but you have to get it done so you reluctantly choose one, deploy it and move on.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Editor:</strong>&nbsp;Our CEO doesn't like it, can we have the YouTube video ABOVE the Main Rich Text area on the homepage again?</em></p>\n<p>🤬 Ya... we've all been there.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Editor:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>I need to create a new page for our online leaderboards, it needs to show the top 10 players, but also provide a detailed leaderboard where people can explore the entire list.</em></p>\n<p>Alright, sounds fun. You get to play around with the Oculus Leaderboards API, create a new content model for this new type of page, create a new static page route, and mess around with some responsive tables. A few coffees later, and a sleepless night, and you get it done. This new leaderboard page now has two main components on the page, one is the top leaders, and the other is the full leaderboard.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong><em>Editor:<span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong><em>Oh, can we have the top leaders on our home page as well?</em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Ok, that didn't come up as a requirement during discussions, but that's fine. It's not too complicated to extract that functionality into a reusable component. So you do just that, you spend some time refactoring your code and then you add it to your&nbsp;landing page HTML template and deploy your update.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><em><strong>Editor:</strong></em><em><span>&nbsp;</span>The top leaders are showing on the press page, we don't want it to show there.</em></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Oh, right! It's using a shared HTML template between the home and press page. You now need to handle that logic in your code as well, further complicating your solution.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\">Learn more <a href=\"https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032554331\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Elements of Page Management In Agility CMS</h2>\n<p>With Agility CMS, you can define three things that make development and editing simple. Page templates, module definitions, and digital channels and sitemaps. Let&rsquo;s take a look at these three elements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/agility-sneak-peek_-headless-page-management-2.jpg\" alt=\"headless cms page management editor tools\" width=\"701\" height=\"368\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page Templates: </strong>Templates allow developers to determine a name and a set of modules where content editors can add content. Developers can also write code to render this template into an HTML document.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Modules: </strong>Modules are reusable sets of fields that can go from a header to more complex UI elements such as a sliding image carousel. In short, modules are the building blocks that enable complex websites.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Digital Channels and Sitemaps: </strong>A sitemap is a content structure that developers use to render the website. In Agility CMS, websites have one or more sitemaps defined, each in its own channel, enabling multi-site management and granular control over each digital property.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Headless Page Management In Agility CMS</h2>\n<p>Most developers and architects start building their content using simple content definitions, and while that&rsquo;s a good way to get started, it doesn&rsquo;t scale well. That&rsquo;s why we offer users a built-in page management system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Page management empowers editors to create and manage content using reusable building blocks, also called modules. Using these building blocks, editors can manage their site&rsquo;s page tree, edit SEO, and determine content relationships and the functionalities of each page. Also, developers can choose which modules editors can add, where they go, and what they do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Page management also includes page templates. We provide the ability to create templates to narrow down the possibilities of what kind of content your website shows, giving the editors the tools to customize them. Each page template has content zones that give editors a location to drag and drop modules.</p>\n<h2>Empowering Content Editors and Developers.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The main thing about Agility CMS is that instead of coding and routing each page individually, developers now have to code only a few page templates and modules. These templates can be reused across the website, sharply reducing the amount of work that developers need to do from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, with the help of page management, content editors can create and move pages around the sitemap in any way they see fit, adding modules to the websites and updating the properties of these modules as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ready for more effective content management or you&rsquo;re looking to future-proof your company, start a conversation with our experts or contact us to <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/contact-us/chat-sales\">request a demo</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Agility CMS&nbsp;Handles Pages</h2>\n<p>Agility CMS allows you to define 3 things that make working with pages really easy for both content editors and developers to work with. Developers set up the templates and definitions, while content editors determine how and where they want to use those templates and definitions. This part of the content architecture is fundamental to the success of any CMS solution that includes a website.</p>\n<h3>Page Templates</h3>\n<p>This allows a developer to determine a template name and a set of module zones that content editors can drop content into using modules. The developer can then write code in the website to render this template into HTML.</p>\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n<p>Modules are the building blocks that enable a content editor to create a complex website structure with tools the developer has set up for them to be successful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/module-on-a-page.png\" alt=\"Modules in Agility CMS \" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<p>This allows a developer to define a set of fields to render a reusable item inside a module zone of a template.

Each digital channel can be used to control a separate digital property. This could, for example, be used for a contest or a completely separate branded site.</p>\n<p>Essentially a sitemap is a nested content structure which the developer will use to render on the website.

This is where all your main lists and items will live, and this is where you'll create most of your content that is reused across multiple destinations or endpoints, such as your app, social networks, etc.</p>\n<p>The pages section, however, is often the first place that users look to find the content they are working on, as the primary responsibility of your content teams is the website itself, and finding what page something on just makes sense to people.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Ready for More Effective Content Management?</h2>\n<p>At Agility CMS, our goal is to help you grow through smart, strategic, and agile content management.

Or, they immediately narrow their shortlist down to headless content management systems that cater for their industry specifically. In both scenarios, we&rsquo;ve found brands to be limiting themselves&mdash;and their options&mdash;for the sake of familiarity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In fact, going for a platform that isn&rsquo;t an obvious choice for your industry may lead to great ideas and new opportunities for growth that you hadn&rsquo;t considered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before we begin, let's answer a foundational question:</p>\n<h2>What is a Headless CMS?</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/h4msiMN9ke8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The key to <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/page-management-in-agility-cms-vs-other-headless-cmss\" target=\"_self\">choosing a headless CMS</a> is to understand your unique requirements and those of your customers and to pick a solution that can accommodate these. In this article, we bring you the top 11 questions you should ask yourself and your stakeholders before choosing the headless or decoupled CMS that&rsquo;s right for your brand&rsquo;s present, and future.</p>\n<h2>10 questions you should ask yourself and your stakeholders before choosing a headless or decoupled CMS</h2>\n<p>Here are the top 10 questions you should ask yourself before you dive-in into our <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/the-ultimate-50-point-checklist-for-choosing-a-headless-cms\" target=\"_self\">Ultimate 50-point Checklist for choosing a new CMS</a>!</p>\n<h3><strong>1. What&rsquo;s your budget for CMS?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/budget for cms.jpg\" alt=\"what is your budget for cms\" width=\"497\" height=\"261\" /></strong></p>\n<p>The first question before you even begin your search for a headless CMS platform is, what&rsquo;s your budget? This will help you rule out whatever options are off the table from the very beginning and prevent you from wasting your time researching solutions that you will never be able to adopt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Understanding the scope and size of your project, as well as of the CMS platforms available, is a good way of gauging what a reasonable budget may be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many CMSs now start with <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/product/pricing/package-details\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Trial</a> and offer a number of <a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/product/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pricing packages</a> to fit your needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Is your organization paying too much for hosting, and licensing costs? A headless CMS uses a cloud-multitenant architecture. It eliminates the need for costly installations and upgrades to the hosting environment. We highly recommend this architecture because of its easy upgrades and security benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, if a marketing department wishes to create a new series of product mini-sites, they can go straight into the CMS and start creating immediately without having to wait for developers to build CMS-based templates. This means your up-front cost is diminished because you can start with smaller solutions and then build your way up versus starting with one BIG install. It&rsquo;s always best to start small and then scale up as you need to.&nbsp; <br /><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/jamstack-webinar-why-jamstack-why-now-and-why-agility-cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JAMStack approach</a>&nbsp;can save you money because it allows you to update your website page by page instead of doing the full rebuild.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. What is the purpose of your website (and your broader digital experience)?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-your-website.jpg\" alt=\"what is the purpose of your website\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Once you have budget considerations out of the way, the next thing you should consider is: what is the purpose of your digital system? Is it intended as a long-term business website, or are you building it for a short-term project?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This question will be important when considering your site&rsquo;s content architecture; if you're thinking long-term, your site should be built in a way that is flexible enough for any future developments, growth and use cases. This approach will help you avoid any future unforeseen costs brought on by a badly planned content architecture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, you're building a short-term site, you may want to put all your efforts into making the site look exactly the way you'd like it to look right now, potentially saving time and resources that you would otherwise spend planning your content architecture. Keep this in mind when choosing a headless CMS, as different platforms may be geared towards different timelines and take different approaches to content architecture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another aspect to think about in regard to your site's purpose is whether you're looking only for a CMS, or for a CMS provider:<br /><br />Are you just looking for a tool that your development team can use to build your site, or would you prefer a provider that is able to guide you through the process, to provide support and to maintain your site for you? These are the questions to keep in mind, as they'll come with different costs and platforms. Knowing the answers to these questions will help you choose the best Headless CMS for your brand.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. What are your performance and integration needs?</strong><br /><strong></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/what-are-your-performance-and-integration-needs.jpg\" alt=\"3. What are your performance and integration needs\" /></strong></p>\n<p>The nature of your site will determine what your hosting and integration needs are and it's important to think of these in advance. Particularly online storefronts tend to be integration-heavy and often require scalable hosting options to prevent the site from crashing during high-traffic streaks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even if your site is not an online store, it is still important to determine first what your performance and integration needs are and then choose a headless CMS solution that can accommodate these. This goes hand in hand with planning your content architecture; as long as you've mapped out your entire site, you'll be aware of what particular integrations are needed. In the same way, thinking about your top use cases and expected traffic fluctuations will give you a better idea of what your hosting needs will be. Mapping all this in advance will help you make a better choice of which headless CMS to go with.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>\n<h3><strong>4. Which channels do you want a presence on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/which-channels-do-you-want-a-presence-on.jpg\" alt=\"Which channels do you want a presence on&nbsp;\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Headless CMSs allow you to provide an omnichannel experience for your customers. This added flexibility offers an advantage as it means that the things can remain the same across multiple touchpoints within the customer journey. However, you do need to decide what channels will work best for your product or service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just because you can provide an omnichannel experience doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should do so. Spreading yourself too thin and trying to be too many places at once is a recipe for disaster, no matter the capabilities of your content management system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, you are likely to have a web page or app with mobile capabilities. However, knowing beforehand which additional channels will work best for your audience, whether that be digital signage, smart speaker apps or something else entirely can go a long way. The channels you decide to be on will help to determine your overall marketing strategy, and your CMS needs to be able to provide a robust experience. The key to a great omnichannel experience is consistency. You can&rsquo;t just have a presence on a platform; you also need to be able to personalize the experience on different platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><br /><strong>5. What are your internal resource capabilities?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/what-are-your-internal-resource-capabilities.jpg\" alt=\"What are your internal resource capabilities&nbsp;\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Once you've established your integration and performance needs, it's time to think logistics. Who will actually build and maintain your website? Do you have in-house developers? Are your content editors technical or non-technical?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have in-house developers, keeping them in the decision-making process will be a key way to ensure that whatever headless CMS platform you choose uses programming languages that your developers are familiar with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many will agree that the biggest benefit of a headless CMS is how easy and fast it is to manage your content. The CMS implementation is cleaner meaning the CMS tool is purely for storing content and isn&rsquo;t cluttered with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that&rsquo;s irrelevant to business users and other resources that&rsquo;s development only.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You will also need to work with your development team, agency or CMS provider to ensure that the site is coded in a way that reduces content editors&rsquo; reliance on developers as much as possible, especially if your content editors are non-technical. If every time you make an update to your website you need to rely on developers, you will waste precious time and resources, so make sure that your CMS allows you to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong><em><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/download/50-point-checklist-headless-cms?source=cta-bottom-blogpost\" target=\"_self\">You are half way there! Switch to your Your Ultimate 50-Point Checklist for Choosing a Headless CMS if you feel ready.</a></em></p>\n<h3><strong>6. Are you forgetting your marketers?</strong><br /><strong></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/are-you-fogetting-marketers.jpg\" alt=\"marketers\" /></strong></p>\n<p>One of the issues with some CMS platforms is creating and editing the content is quickly done by non-technical team members, but, then the job of displaying the content in a visually appealing way is only possible with the help of tech-savvy developers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Too often, going headless means sacrificing marketer autonomy and speed for developmental freedom and more channels. It would be best if you opted for a hybrid headless CMS that can offer both without compromise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Developers want to spend their time coding new features and not fixing minor issues or updating content. The best CMS platforms make it easy for developers to set up proper structures and workflows for marketers and content editors to operate; empowering both the marketer and the developer to produce the best content.</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h3><strong>7. How soon do you need your solution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/how-soon.jpg\" alt=\"how soon digital solution\" /></strong></p>\n<p>What is your project timeline? Are you planning a long-term website and ready to wait a few months to ensure the site is optimal? Or do you need something quick within a few days or weeks?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need something fast, the best option may be to go for a pre-templated solution, although this will mean being quite restricted in terms of design. Picking a CMS that provides templates and that allows your team to quickly put a site together without relying on any external parties will be the best option.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking long-term, focusing on ensuring your design serves your unique business needs, and not the other way around, will enable you to build a more effective site and, ultimately, a more valuable tool in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<h3><strong>8. What are your security requirements?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/what-are-your-security-requirements.jpg\" alt=\"What are your security requirements&nbsp;\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Security is always a concern for businesses building new websites, although how much of a priority it is will depend on the nature of your company. The key is to ensure that your site has the necessary security measures in place, without hindering performance or user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The general perception is that open source platforms aren&rsquo;t as secure as proprietary platforms, which isn&rsquo;t always the case. However, as a rule of thumb, make sure that the platform you choose can be made secure according to your unique needs and that it has the necessary certifications. Thinking about this in advance will prevent any unforeseen security hiccups along the way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>9. Is commerce part of your brand's future?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/agility-peak-sdk-6.jpg\" alt=\"commerce\" width=\"509\" height=\"267\" /></strong></p>\n<p>When deciding on which CMS platform you should use, you should determine if you plan to offer a commerce option in the future. The likelihood that you answer yes to this question is quite high as by the year 2040, as much as <a href=\"https://profitindustry.com/ecommerce-statistics/\">95% of shopping will be facilitated by eCommerce</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That said, it is vital to go with a CMS that has robust commerce platform integrations and APIs that won't hinder headless commerce projects. There are several eCommerce platforms able to provide your customers with an online shopping experience, but they aren't all right for your brand. The best CMS gives you the flexibility to choose the right one for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ecommerce happens over multiple touchpoints and channels and therefore falls under the same requirements for an omnichannel experience. Factors such as UX design play a crucial role in whether a customer decides to purchase from a particular brand or not. Also, many customers make purchases from brands that they resonate with, or that have a great story they can support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those brands that are successful when it comes to eCommerce have various content types that help to tell their story. They also provide international buying options and can deliver their content and products to any device from a web page to a kiosk screen, smartwatch or smart speaker. None of that would be possible without the right CMS.</p>\n<h3><br /><strong>10. Are you planning to scale and grow into new markets?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/are-you-planning-to-scale-and-grow-into-new-markets.jpg\" alt=\"Are you planning to scale and grow into new markets\" width=\"529\" height=\"278\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Not thinking far enough into the future is a big mistake we see brands making when choosing a headless CMS. If you plan to keep your digital presence small and local, then feel free to skip this point. If not, read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A headless CMS is only as good as its infrastructure. Without enterprise-grade hosting and content delivery networks (CDNs), your digital experience will become slow, difficult to manage, and near-impossible to scale when traffic spikes occur.

Modern development and content tools come together with ecommerce platforms to help drive sales performance.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ecommerce tools on their own aren't enough to maximize your online revenue. Use Agility CMS to promote your products with personalized experiences that you can continue to test and optimize over time.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Interested in learning how? Let's get started!</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Better Ecommerce Website Architecture: Headless Commerce</span></h2>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is Headless Commerce?</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Headless commerce architecture is similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/guide/what-is-a-headless-cms\" target=\"_self\">headless CMS</a>&nbsp;architecture in the sense that a&nbsp;<strong>headless commerce solution can store, manage, publish, and pull content from other applications headlessly. In other words, you can pull in content from anywhere, and push it out to any front-end.</strong></span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong></strong></span></p>\n<p>With commerce in the equation, retailers and wholesalers can benefit by extending their experiences and products to new channels. Whereas a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/guide/top-10-reasons-why-you-should-choose-a-headless-cms-over-a-traditional-cms\" target=\"_self\">legacy CMS </a>couldn&rsquo;t display products and complete checkouts on a digital sign or smartwatch, a headless commerce solution can.</p>\n<p><em>Learn More:<a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/guide/what-is-a-headless-cms\">&nbsp;What is a Headless CMS?</a></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></p>\n<h2>Why should you use Headless Commerce? Benefits of the Jamstack approach.</h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We recommend using&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">headless CMS</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">headless ecommerce</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;to build a modern&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/top-jamstack-pioneers\">Jamstack</a> website</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The CMS and ecommerce APIs will be consumed at build-time to create pages for displaying and promoting your products. These pages will be statically generated and served through a CDN, so they'll always be fast, even during peak periods like Black Friday. By decoupling the website from the ecommerce and CMS data, we remove the bottlenecks associated with monolithic architectures. It's important to note that we won't statically serve any user-specific data - we need to render that dynamically at runtime.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We recommend using&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">serverless functions</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;to implement the user-specific data routines that an ecommerce website requires, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Login &amp; User Registration</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Add to Cart &amp; Cart management</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Checkout</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Order Lookup &amp; Management</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Serverless functions allow you to provide all the functionality offered by your headless ecommerce platform of choice, such as </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.shopify.com/plus/solutions/headless-commerce\" class=\"editor-rtfLink\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Shopify</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,&nbsp;</span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.ca/solutions/headless-commerce/\" class=\"editor-rtfLink\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">BigCommerce</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">,&nbsp;</span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stripe.com/\" class=\"editor-rtfLink\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Stripe</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, and others. The URLs of these functions will still be rooted in your website's domain, and any API keys will not be exposed publicly.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></p>\n<p>With a headless eCommerce platform you can:</p>\n<h3>Deliver 1:1 Personalized Experiences</h3>\n<p>A headless solution simplifies personalization for companies in multiple ways. For instance, retailers can integrate region-specific payment methods and offer additional regional payment gateways without re-platforming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, since your backend stores the information multiple channels use, you can distribute personalized offers across devices based on actions your customers have taken on other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Integrate With Third-Party Software</h3>\n<p>Traditional commerce platforms tend to be monolith solutions where if you want to add a new feature you have to use a plugin that slows down your eCommerce store in the long run. For eCommerce retailers, a slow site means fewer customers. Luckily, the headless architecture enables integration with best-of-breed software tools for improved performance.</p>\n<h3>Scale To New Markets and Segments</h3>\n<p>A traditional commerce platform doesn&rsquo;t give customers the option of changing language much less enable content localization in their websites, which represents a barrier for users whose language isn&rsquo;t English or aren&rsquo;t located in an <a href=\"https://preply.com/en/online/english-tutors\" target=\"_self\">English-speaking</a> country. A headless eCommerce solution gives marketers the ability to offer automatic translation for users to give them a seamless storefront experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cut Down IT Costs&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Most headless commerce solutions use a SaaS business model that&rsquo;s based on cloud infrastructure. Commerce cloud platforms like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/partners/integrations/amazon-aws/\">AWS</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/partners/integrations/microsoft-azure/\">Azure</a><span>&nbsp;</span>reduce maintenance costs and increase uptime without increasing your IT costs, especially when compared with traditional, monolith platforms hosted on-premise.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Use Your Favorite Frontend</h3>\n<p><span>Since the headless architecture enables frontend developers to use their preferred frontend frameworks and libraries, the headless approach gives developers almost infinite ways of customizing the presentation layer.</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/apis-vs-sdks-what-s-the-difference\"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>APIs</span></a><span>&nbsp;make connecting the appropriate frontend layer a simple task. With a headless commerce platform, you can create progressive web applications (PWAs) that work seamlessly from your browser and single-page applications for your storefront.</span></p>\n<h3>Centralize Assets and Content</h3>\n<p><span>Ecommerce platforms are known for being hubs where you can centralize and store your data, but with the headless approach, and its flexible backend, things get taken to the next level as it simplifies and streamlines content delivery to different platforms. About content assets, Oulette says that Agility CMS&rsquo; </span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/content-modelling/\"><span>content models</span></a><span>&nbsp;have been helpful when it comes to building shopping carts and product pages. He says</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>&ldquo;A model is basically a component that you create in the CMS and that is then linked to a React component. The cool thing about content models is that when you design your pages, you can come to this page, for example, your own page and you can drag and drop models as you want.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></p>\n<h3>Enable Content Display in Digital Signage and IoT Devices&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Recent research by the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/journal/Journal-of-Advertising-Research-1740-1909\">Journal of Advertising Research</a><span>&nbsp;</span>shows that digital signage can boost incremental sales by as much as 25%, and when you consider how a digital sign can be used to engage a customer, that figure comes as no surprise.</p>\n<h3>Create Jamstack-based Digital Experiences</h3>\n<p>Creating a Jamstack-based eCommerce store will net you benefits you never thought possible to achieve with a traditional eCommerce platform. Even headless-ready platforms like Shopify Plus simply can&rsquo;t compete with the speed and ease of use Jamstack eCommerce frontends can give you. With a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/jamstack-cms/\">Jamstack CMS</a><span>&nbsp;</span>you can implement best-of-breed technologies using APIs to power your eCommerce content management and build a progressive web app.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Deploy Quickly&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>One of the main advantages of the headless commerce approach is that merchants can deploy commerce experiences to a mobile device, a PWA or any frontend to create engaging, native-like commerce experiences across different customer touchpoints.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your Next Steps: Build your Ecommerce Content Architecture</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Agility CMS gives you the ability to control all of the content and pages in your website. You have complete control over the content model itself, such as what fields are available on a blog post and how different types of content relate to each other. Depending on which ecommerce platform you choose to work with, your most significant decision will be where to store your product data. Let's explore a few different options:</span></p>\n<h3>Option 1: Store Product Data in the Ecommerce Platform</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We recommend this approach if you are choosing Shopify or BigCommerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You set up the products and variants in the ecommerce system and relate those products to content in Agility CMS based on the product identifier. You can also override product data in the CMS when needed.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With this approach, you will be managing the ecommerce and CMS data separately.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Option 2: Store Product Data in Agility CMS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is the most flexible solution in terms of the actual structure of your product content. Create your specialized content model that represents your products exactly as you want to market them.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">We recommend this when using a direct Stripe integration with your website.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Option 3: Store Product Data in an External System</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you already utilize an external product database or management system, we recommend staying with that system.</span></li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can either pull those products into your website via an API or synchronize them with Agility CMS.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Headless CMS, Ecommerce, and Website Frameworks</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/article_attachments/4403552722701/Slide1.jpeg\" alt=\"Headless CMS, Ecommerce, and Website Frameworks\" width=\"715\" height=\"402\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<h3>Choose your Ecommerce Platform</h3>\n<p>You have lots of options to choose from when composing the parts of your system.&nbsp; Along with Agility CMS, you can use<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/plus/solutions/headless-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/solutions/headless-commerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BigCommerce</a>, or any headless ecommerce platform that has a mature API.&nbsp; You'll see later why we prefer Shopify and BigCommerce 🧐.</p>\n<h3>Choose your Website Framework</h3>\n<p>You can choose pretty much any modern website framework to build your solution with. Still, the most popular ones with the best examples are<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Next.js</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gatsby.js</a>, both of which support Static Site Generation plus Dynamic Functions.&nbsp; They are the leading frameworks, but you can still choose Nuxt, Eleventy, or even Hugo - you just won't have such a broad foundation to start from.</p>\n<h2>Next.js Commerce</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/article_attachments/4403553448845/Screen_Shot_2021-06-22_at_11.51.46_AM.png\" alt=\"next.js ecommerce website screenshot\" width=\"689\" height=\"455\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></a></h2>\n<p>The Vercel team has built a project that works with multiple headless ecommerce platforms, including BigCommerce and Shopify.&nbsp; That project allows you to simply plugin the API credentials of your ecommerce platform, set a config variable, and you're off and running!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The code below shows the example env configuration - simply change the COMMERCE_PROVIDER to use a different platform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>AGILITY_GUID=\nAGILITY_API_FETCH_KEY=\nAGILITY_API_PREVIEW_KEY=<br />\n# Available providers: bigcommerce, shopify, swell\nCOMMERCE_PROVIDER=<br />\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=\nBIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=\nBIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=\nBIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=<br />\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<br />\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_STORE_ID=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SWELL_PUBLIC_KEY=<br />\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SALEOR_API_URL=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SALEOR_CHANNEL=\n</pre>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3>Next.js Commerce with Agility</h3>\n<p>The team here at Agility has taken that idea to the next level and forked the work from the Vercel team.&nbsp; Our version of the project brings the same ecommerce functionality<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>adds CMS content from Agility into the mix!

When you visit your local fast food restaurant and order using a digital screen, that&rsquo;s headless commerce in full swing.</p>\n<p>Let's see how our clients are taking the lead in the ecommerce space:</p>\n<h3>Compass Group Canada</h3>\n<p><span>Compass Group Canada is a global leader in contract foodservice and support services, managing tens of thousands of meal plans for educational institutions, professional and leisure organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/screenshot-2021-02-18-142502.png\" alt=\"compass group canada headless ecommerce\" width=\"704\" height=\"368\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks to Agility CMS, now students and staff can easily order meals on any device. Content is easily managed by multiple stakeholders, with secure user accounts set up for 75 content editors.</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/case-studies/compass-group-canada\">Using the Agility CMS, Compass Group</a> is a new responsive site that houses all schools, with an improved, easier-to-use portal and robust Ecommerce capability.

The new site also provides a consistent layout across all individual school sites.</span></p>\n<h3>Visit Orlando</h3>\n<p>Visit Orlando is the official tourism association for Orlando, the most-visited destination in the United States. They are a registered not-for-profit trade association that represents moreover 1,000 member companies making up Central Florida&rsquo;s tourism community.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Visit Orlando website screenshot\" src=\"https://static.agilitycms.com/vo-3-small.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"449\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before headless eCommerce was implemented, the staff had to manually issue tickets because their former site couldn't handle a ton of traffic and would crash during their busy times. Tickets also had to be processed in batches (once a day), and because of this, the staff was burdened with the workload while customers were upset that they couldn't purchase last-minute tickets.</p>\n<p>Rolling out<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/case-studies/visit-orlando\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headless commerce with Agility CMS</a>, online revenue went up by 20%.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, in December, the CIO and Director both remarked that they had taken a 4-day weekend for Thanksgiving for the first time in many years!</p>\n<h2><span>Start Your Headless Commerce Journey: Set An eCommerce Store With Agility CMS, Next.js, and Snipcart</span></h2>\n<p><span>Creating an eCommerce store with Agility CMS is simple because, with Agility, you can deliver content to any front end using any coding language via RESTful APIs, regular APIs and GraphQL, our open source SDKs, and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/jamstack-cms/\"><span>Jamstack architecture</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Agility CMS offers marketers built-in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agilitycms.com/resources/agility-sneak-peek/agility-sneak-peek-headless-page-management\">page management</a>&nbsp;features, with which they can create, manage and organize pages using reusable blocks and sitemaps &ndash; all without having to rely on a developer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Plus, Agility CMS enables you to integrate with the solution of your liking.
